## 🏆 ABC PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

### **The Deal:**  
- **FREE for ABC** through September 2026  
- Matt plays bocce in ABC leagues (testing + feedback)  
- Build toward ABC Open (Sept 2026) showcase  
- Public endorsement at 6-9 months if working well  
- Use ABC Open as proof for expansion to other leagues

### **Why This Works:**  
- No sales friction (ABC says yes easily)  
- Real-world testing environment (not theory)  
- Matt dogfoods his own product (best feedback)  
- 10 months to build trust before asking for endorsement  
- ABC Open = forcing function + live public demo  
- Other leagues see it working, not PowerPoint
