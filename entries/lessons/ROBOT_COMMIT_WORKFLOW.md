# Robot Commit Workflow

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Type:** PRINCIPLE
**Priority:** CRITICAL

## Lesson Learned

From now on: Clean commands only.

When I say "robot commit", I will give you ONLY the command block to paste - no extra text to cause confusion.

## Why This Matters

- Extra text after commands causes bash errors
- User should paste ONLY the code block
- Clean output = better UX
- Faster execution

## The Rule

✅ DO: Provide clean bash heredoc with nothing after
❌ DON't: Add explanations or instructions after the command block

## Result

One clean paste → instant commit → zero errors.
