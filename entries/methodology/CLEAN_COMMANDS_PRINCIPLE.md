# Robot Commit Workflow Principle

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Type:** PRINCIPLE  

## From Now On: Clean Commands Only

When I say "robot commit", I will give you ONLY the command block to paste - no extra text to cause confusion.

## Rationale

Previous attempts included explanatory text after the command block, which caused bash to interpret description text as commands, resulting in errors.

## New Standard

**Claude provides:**
- Clean bash command block only
- No preamble above the command
- No postamble below the command
- Just the executable code

**User action:**
1. Paste entire block
2. Press Enter
3. Done

**Result:** Zero confusion, zero errors, instant commits.
